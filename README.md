# A DILLEMA I FELT INITIALLY
## Me and Aayushi tried sorting out the problem we overcame (of course later) in MS WORD which mainly included upper and lower case alphabet letters.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
At certain times, me or let's assume any random user might mistakenly forget to switch off/switch on or lock/unlock the Capslock key in my or their key board and blindly type long statements in a format they aren't meant to be without looking over at the mistake unnoticingly commited. Now realising what has been done, I as a total begginer to this new world which had already drenched itself from head to toe into technology had to delete the entire pre-written text and re-write the same using the properly formatted letters filling up the sentences correctly.
